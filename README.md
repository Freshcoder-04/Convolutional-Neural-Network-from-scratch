# Convolutional-Neural-Network-from-scratch

### This project consists of 2 notebooks:
1. CNN.ipynb: This notebook contains a CNN classifier that takes an image as input and tells us the number of digits written in that particular image.
2. MultilabelCNN.ipynb: This notebook contains a CNN classifier that takes an image as input and tells us the digits that are in the image.

### Refer to the notebooks for all the information regarding this project.

### Note that the notebook was run on kaggle with GPU.

### The notebook covers all inferences and observations regarding the model. The results for hyperparameter tuning are also available to be checked in the notebook itself.

### Please unzip the dataset file and then run the notebook.

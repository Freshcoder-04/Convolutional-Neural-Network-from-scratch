# Convolutional-Neural-Network-from-scratch

In this project, I have implemented a CNN classifier which can classify the number of digits from the images in the MultiMNIST Dataset.

Note that the notebook was run on kaggle with GPU.

The notebook covers all inferences and observations regarding the model. The results for hyperparameter tuning are also available to be checked in the notebook itself.

Please unzip the dataset file and then run the notebook.
